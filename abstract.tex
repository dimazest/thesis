Categorical compositional methods \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-4394} cover a rather large number of grammatical phenomena such as composition of a verb with its arguments, adjectives and relative clauses. The advances in lexical semantics \cite{mikolov2013efficient,baroni-dinu-kruszewski:2014:P14-1,TACL570} are successfully applied in compositional tasks \cite{milajevs-EtAl:2014:EMNLP2014}. However, it is not known whether there are models that are good in both lexical and compositional tasks. This work systematically studies a large number of parameters and selects the best behaving models taking overfitting \cite{lapesa2014large}. Here we show that a careful model selection leads to improvements on several lexical and compositional task in comparison to the current state-of-the-art models. While the best model is dependent on a task, a universal task-independant space is withing the 10\% margin.
