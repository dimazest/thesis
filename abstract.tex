Categorical compositional methods \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-4394} cover a large number of grammatical phenomena such as composition of a verb with its arguments, an adjective with a noun and a relative clause with a main clause. The advances in lexical semantics \cite{mikolov2013efficient,baroni-dinu-kruszewski:2014:P14-1,TACL570} are successfully applied in compositional tasks \cite{milajevs-EtAl:2014:EMNLP2014}. However, it is not known whether there are word representations that are good in both lexical and compositional tasks.
%
This work systematically tests a large number of distributional word representations varying the parameters of the co-occurrence weighting functions.
The goal of the work is to find the best behaving parameters taking overfitting \cite{lapesa2014large} into account.
%
Here we show that careful model selection leads to improvements on several lexical and compositional tasks in comparison to the current state of the art methods and avoids overfitting.
