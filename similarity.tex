\section{The notion of similarity}
\label{sec:similarity}

Similarity is the degree of resemblance between two objects or events \cite{WCS:WCS1282} and plays a crucial role in psychological theories of knowledge and behaviour, where it is used to explain such phenomena as classification and conceptualisation \cite{Tversky1977,1986-13502-00119860101,medin1993respects,Markman1996,hahn1997concepts}. \textit{Fruit} is a \emph{category} because it is a practical generalisation. Fruits are sweet and generally constitute desserts, so when one is presented with an unseen fruit, one can hypothesise that it is served toward the end of a dinner.

Generalisations are extremely powerful in describing a language, as well. The verb \textit{runs} requires its subject to be singular. \textit{Verb}, \textit{subject} and \textit{singular} are categories that are used to describe English grammar. When one encounters an unknown word and is told that it is a verb, one will immediately have an idea about how to use it, assuming that it is used similarly to other English verbs.

From a computational perspective, this motivates and guides the development of \emph{semantic similarity} (in the sense that they measure the degree of resemblance of meaning) components that are embedded into natural language processing systems.

In Information Retrieval (IR), queries are expanded with related terms to increase the number of retrieved relevant documents. For example, if a user issues the query \textit{lakes in Sweden}, the system might add related words to the query such as \textit{lake}, \textit{reservoir}, \textit{river} or even \textit{swim} so that the documents that do not contain the word \textit{lakes} are retrieved \cite{Xu:1996:QEU:243199.243202}.
% \cite{Salton:1975:VSM:361219.361220}

A dependency parser might benefit from a generalisation about the part of speech tag of a word which did not occur in the training data, based on its occurrence pattern in a large corpus of documents from the web \cite{hermann-blunsom:2013:ACL2013,andreas-klein:2014:P14-2}.

The information that the word \textit{carpet} is similar in meaning to the word \textit{mat} might be exploited by a language model in estimating the probability of the sentence \textit{the cat set on the carpet}, even if it did not occur in the corpus, but \textit{cat sat on the mat} did \cite{bengio2006}.

A dialogue act tagging system might require classification of an utterance based on its role in a dialogue, such as a question or an acknowledgement \cite{kalchbrenner-blunsom:2013:CVSC}.

The examples show that similarity is a broad term that is task-dependent. An IR system needs to identify semantically similar (\textit{lake}, \textit{river}) and related (\textit{lake}, \textit{swim}) terms. A dependency parser benefits from the similarity of word usage. A language model exploits similarity in word meaning. A dialogue act tagging system relies on the role similarity of the utterances. Also different linguistic entities are compared, the similarity can be measured between pairs of words and pairs of sentences.

\section{Representation for similarity measurement}
\label{sec:word-meaning}

According to \newcite{WCS:WCS1282}, ``similarity is an essentially psychological notion, based on the way we represent objects, that is, the way they appear to us.'' Since it is not yet known how objects are represented in human mind, the computational way of representing meaning to measure semantic similarity has to be agreed upon. However, one needs to be extremely careful when the meaning representation is decided, as it is unavoidably connected to the \emph{meaning of words in isolation}.

% The semantic formalisation of similarity is based on two ideas. The occurrence pattern of a word \emph{defines} its meaning \cite{firth1957lingtheory}, while the difference in occurrence between two words \emph{quantifies} the difference in their meaning \cite{harris1954distributional}.

Frege discusses two conflicting principles of meaning \cite{Janssen2001}. According to \emph{the principle of compositionality}, isolated word meanings are the building blocks of sentence meanings:
\begin{displayquote}[\cite{Janssen2001}]
The meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and the syntactic rule by which they are combined.
\end{displayquote}
%
However, according to \emph{the principle of contextuality}, the word meaning in isolation is not defined:
\begin{displayquote}[\cite{Janssen2001}]
Never ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a sentence.
\end{displayquote}

It is worth noting here that similarity in isolation is also problematic because the number of features an entity has is infinite, and it is easy to show that two entities will always have an infinite amount of common features \cite{goodman1972problems,hahn1997concepts}. For example, the tree next to my house is similar to my house because both of them are less than one kilometre in height, both of them are less than two kilometre in height, both of them are less than three kilometre in height and so on. 

To make similarity measurement possible, it has to be measured \emph{under a given description} \cite{WCS:WCS1282,medin1993respects,Markman1996}, thus, similarity is always contextualised. In other words, similarity emerges only when the possible properties are weighted. In our example, the tree and the house are similar with respect to the colour: both of them are green (the height properties are assigned zero weight).
% On the other side, \newcite{Huth2016} were able to comprehensively map individual words across cortex, meaning that there are word representations supporting the idea of \newcite{WCS:WCS1282}.

Frege's principle of contextuality allows us to define the meaning of a word by identifying its contribution to the meaning of a sentence. Firth's \citeyearpar{firth1957lingtheory} famous quote that ``you shall know a word by the company it keeps,'' suggests that the word meaning can be \emph{modelled} as the combination of the meanings of its occurrences in sentences of a corpus. Note that this does not provide the absolute word meaning, but only its meaning relative to the corpus. This assumption is also supported by the distributional hypothesis of \newcite{harris1954distributional} that the differences of occurrences of two words quantify the difference in their relative meaning, but do not necessarily define the meaning.

Once the relative word meaning is accepted, compositionality can be used to obtain representations of phrases and sentences \cite{THEO:THEO373,Dowty1980,sep-montague-semantics,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-4394,baroni2014frege}.

\section{Word meaning}
\label{sec:distr-hypoth}

% In principle, we would like to capture the intuition that while \textit{John} and \textit{Mary} are distinct entities, they are rather similar to each other (both of them are humans) and are dissimilar to \textit{dog}, \textit{pavement} or \textit{idea}. However, we start with the word meaning representation that captures the fact that entities are distinct, but does not provide the means to measure similarity.

% The same applies at the phrase and sentence level: \textit{dogs chase cats} is similar in meaning to \textit{hounds pursue kittens}, but less so to \textit{cats chase dogs} (despite the lexical overlap).

\subsection{Formal semantics}
\label{sec:classical-approaches}

Formal semantics provides the means to infer some piece of information from another. The main studied relation is the entailment of sentences, for example, \textit{John swims in Åresjön} entails \textit{John swims in a Swedish lake}. To evaluate entailment, the sentences are converted to formulas. The words correspond to symbols in formal logic.

The individual \textit{Åresjön} corresponds to the symbol \textit{Åresjön'}, which is mapped to the actual lake by the interpretation function $\mathcal{I}$.

One-place properties are seen as sets of individuals, so $\mathcal{I}(\mathit{Swedish'})$ is a set that contains $\mathcal{I}(\mathit{Åresjön'})$ and $\mathcal{I}(\mathit{Väsman'})$ among many other entities.

\textit{Swim'} is a two-place predicate that is represented as a set that contains the pairs between which the relation holds, so if John actually swims in Åresjön, then $\mathcal{I}(\mathit{swim'})$ will contain the pair $(\mathcal{I}(\mathit{John'}), \mathcal{I}(\mathit{Åresjön'}))$.

While such formalism is very powerful for entailment detection between sentences, similarity measurement is problematic, because there is no relation between atomic symbols: we only know that \textit{Åresjön} and \textit{Väsman} correspond to different entities in the universe, but know nothing about their properties.

\subsection{Distributional semantics}
\label{sec:distr-repr}

Distributional methods provide a way to measure similarity between symbols. The representations are produced by directly exploiting Harris' \citeyearpar{harris1954distributional} intuition that similar words occur in similar contexts.

For example, one can construct a vector space in which the dimensions correspond to contexts, which are usually other words. The word vector components can then be calculated by taking the frequency with which the word co-occurred with the corresponding contexts within a predefined window in a corpus of interest. The similarity in meaning can be expressed via a suitable distance metric within the space.

\begin{wraptable}[10]{O}{7cm}
  \centering
  %\vspace{-1em}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    & philosophy & book & school \\
    \midrule
    John & 4  & 60 & 59  \\
    Mary & 0  & 10 & 22  \\
    girl & 0  & 19 & 93  \\
    boy  & 0  & 12 & 146 \\
    idea & 10 & 47 & 39  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Word co-occurrence frequencies extracted from the BNC}
  \label{tab:comparison}
\end{wraptable}

Table~\ref{tab:comparison} shows five three-dimensional vectors for words \textit{Mary}, \textit{John}, \textit{girl}, \textit{boy} and \textit{idea}. These are \textit{target words}.  The words \textit{philosophy}, \textit{book} and \textit{school} label vector space dimensions and are referred to as \emph{context words}.

As the vector for \textit{Mary} is closer to \textit{girl} than it is to \textit{boy} in the vector space, we can say that \textit{Mary}'s contexts are similar to \textit{girl}'s (and less similar to \textit{boy}'s), therefore \textit{Mary} is semantically more similar to \textit{girl} than to \textit{boy}.

Mathematically, the similarity can be expressed using, for instance, the cosine of the angle between two vectors:
%
\begin{align*}
\cos(\theta) &=
\frac{\ov{\mathit{Mary}}\cdot\ov{\mathit{girl}}}
{||\ov{\mathit{Mary}}||||\ov{\mathit{girl}}||} =
%
\frac{(0\times0) + (10\times19) + (22\times93)}
% * <sdyck@ualberta.ca> 2016-11-03T02:13:08.483Z:
%

%
% adding parentheses makes it easier to tell where the numbers came from, but feel free to remove them if you want/disagree. 
%
% ^.
{\sqrt{0^2 + 10^2 + 22^2}\sqrt{0^2 + 19^2 + 93^2}} \approx
\frac{2236}{2294} \approx 0.975
 \\
\cos(\phi) &=
\frac{\ov{\mathit{Mary}}\cdot\ov{\mathit{boy}}}
{||\ov{\mathit{Mary}}||||\ov{\mathit{boy}}||} =
%
\frac{(0\times0) + (10\times12) + (22\times146)}
{\sqrt{0^2 + 10^2 + 22^2}\sqrt{0^2 + 12^2 + 146^2}} \approx
\frac{3332}{3540} \approx 0.941
\end{align*}
%
where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors of \textit{Mary} and \textit{girl}; and $\phi$ is the angle between the vectors of \textit{Mary} and \textit{boy}.

In the current example of a na{\"\i}ve vector space, \textit{John} is also closer to \textit{girl} than to \textit{boy}, which is counter-intuitive. This might be because of the small number of dimensions used, the poor selection of the context words, or the usage of raw co-occurrence numbers. The importance of parameters is discussed in details in Section~\ref{sec:parameter-selection-intro}.

\subsection{Neural word embeddings}
\label{sec:neural-embedding}

Deep learning techniques use the distributional hypothesis differently. Instead of relying on observed co-occurrence frequencies, a neural model is trained to maximise some objective function related to, for example, the probability of observing the surrounding words in some context \cite{mikolov2013distributed}:
% * <sdyck@ualberta.ca> 2016-11-03T02:27:02.618Z:
%
% > differently
%
% differently than what? co-occurrence​ based vectors?
%
% ^.
%
\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{T}\sum^{T}_{t=1}\sum_{-c \leq j \leq c, j\neq0} \log p(w_{t+j}|w_t)
  \label{eq:objective-func}
\end{align}
%
\noindent
Maximising this function produces vectors which maximise the
conditional probability of observing words in a context around the
target word $w_t$, where $c$ is the size of the training context, and
$w_1 w_2, \cdots w_T$ is a sequence of training words. Therefore, they
capture the distributional intuition and can express degrees of
lexical similarity.

They have also been proved to be successful at other tasks \cite{mikolov2013linguistic}. The vectors obtained by this method encode not only attributional similarity (similar words are close to each other), but also relational similarities \cite{Turney:2010:FMV:1861751.1861756}. For example, it is possible to extract the \texttt{singular:plural} relation (\textit{apple}:\textit{apples}, \textit{car}:\textit{cars}) using vector subtraction:
%
\begin{align*}
  \overrightarrow{\mathit{apple}} - \overrightarrow{\mathit{apples}}
  \approx
  \overrightarrow{\mathit{car}} - \overrightarrow{\mathit{cars}}
\end{align*}
%
also, semantic relationships are preserved:
%
\begin{align*}
  \overrightarrow{\mathit{king}} - \overrightarrow{\mathit{man}}
  \approx
  \overrightarrow{\mathit{queen}} - \overrightarrow{\mathit{woman}}
\end{align*}
%
allowing the formation of analogy queries similar to
$\overrightarrow{\mathit{king}} - \overrightarrow{\mathit{man}} +
\overrightarrow{\mathit{woman}} = \mathtt{?}$, obtaining
$\overrightarrow{\mathit{queen}}$ as the
result.

\newcite{levy2014linguistic} refined the method of retrieving relational similarities by changing the objective function and improved the state-of-the-art results, both for neural embeddings and co-occurrence based vectors. However, recently the evaluation method based on analogies and vector offsets has been criticised---see \newcite{linzen:2016:RepEval}.

\section{Similarity of phrases and sentences}
\label{sec:similarity-compounds}

Both neural and co-occurrence-based approaches have advantages over the formal approaches in their ability to capture lexical semantics and degrees of similarity. However, their success at extending this to the sentence level, and to more complex semantic phenomena, depends on their applicability within compositional models.

\subsection{The principle of compositionality}
\label{sec:formal-semantics}

Formal approaches to the semantics of natural language have built upon the
classical idea of compositionality which states that the meaning of a sentence is a
function of its parts \cite{Janssen2001}. In compositional type-logical
approaches, predicate-argument structures representing phrases and sentences are
built from their constituent parts by general operations such as beta-reduction
within the lambda calculus \cite{THEO:THEO373}: for example, given a semantic
representation of \emph{John} as $\mathit{John}'$, \emph{loves} as
$\lambda y.\lambda x.\mathit{loves}'(x, y)$ and \emph{Mary} as $\mathit{Mary'}$, the sentence \emph{John loves Mary}
can be constructed as
$$
\lambda y.\lambda
x.\mathit{loves}'(x, y)(\mathit{mary}')(\mathit{john}') =
\mathit{loves}'(\mathit{john}', \mathit{mary}')
$$

To get the semantic representation of the sentence \textit{John loves Mary}, we
need to do the following. Syntactic rules define how constituents are combined
% * <sdyck@ualberta.ca> 2016-11-03T03:32:46.899Z:
%
% > need to do the following
%
% What needs to be done? This doesn't fit with how the rest of the paragraph is phrased.
%
% ^.
to form other constituents (and finally a sentence). Translation rules define
how semantic representations of the constituents are combined to get a semantic
representation of the whole.

Categorical grammars are widely used to obtain the syntactic structure of a sentence. Given a set of basic categories $\texttt{ATOM}$, for example $\{\mathit{n}, \mathit{s}, \mathit{np}\}$ complex categories
% * <sdyck@ualberta.ca> 2016-11-05T01:33:12.755Z:
%
% > xample $\{\mathit{n}, \mathit{s}, \mathit{np}\}$ complex categories
%
% what do these categories mean?
%
% ^.
$\mathtt{CAT} \backslash \mathtt{CAT}$ and $\mathtt{CAT}/\mathtt{CAT}$ can be constructed, where $\mathtt{CAT}$ is either an element of \texttt{\texttt{ATOM}} or a complex category. So the transitive verb category is $\mathtt{np}\backslash\mathtt{s}/\mathtt{np}$. Intuitively, we want to say that to obtain a sentence with a transitive verb there must be noun phrases before and after the verb.

Parsing is done by composing categories together according to two rules:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Backward application}: If $\alpha$ is a string of category $A$ and
  $\beta$ is a string of category $A\backslash{}B$, then $\alpha\beta$ is of
  category $B$.
\item \textbf{Forward application}: If $\alpha$ is a string of category $A$ and
  $\beta$ is a string of category $B/A$, then $\beta\alpha$ is of category $B$.
\end{enumerate}

    categories to words: \textit{John} is $\mathit{np}$, loves is
    $\mathit{np}\backslash{}\mathit{s}/\mathit{np}$ and Mary is
    $\mathit{np}$. Backward and forward composition rules derive the syntactic
    tree.}
\label{fig:cg}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cg} illustrates the parse tree for \textit{John loves Mary}
obtained using the category composition rules.

The last step is to map syntactic categories with semantic terms. Again, there
are base types ($e$ for entities and $t$ for sentences) and complex types of the
form $(a \to b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are types. The mapping between syntactic
categories and semantic types is defined as a function $\mathit{type}$:
%
\begin{align*}
  &\mathit{type}(np) = e \\
  &\mathit{type}(s) = t \\
  &\mathit{type}(A/B) = (\mathit{type}(B) \to \mathit{type}(A)) \\
  &\mathit{type}(B\backslash{}A) = (\mathit{type}(B) \to \mathit{type}(A)) \\
\end{align*}

Syntactic backward and forward application corresponds to functional
application. Figure~\ref{fig:syn} shows the final parse tree.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \Tree [
    .$s$~:~$\mathit{loves}'(\mathit{john}',\mathit{mary}')$

        loves

        Mary
      ]
    ]
  ]
  \caption{The final parse tree}
\label{fig:syn}
\end{figure}

Given a suitable pairing between a syntactic grammar, semantic representations and corresponding general combinatory operators, this can produce structured sentential representations with a broad coverage and good generalisability \cite{step2008:2222}. This logical approach is extremely powerful because it can capture complex aspects of meaning such as quantifiers and their interactions \cite{Copestake2005}, and enables inference using well studied and developed logical methods \cite{bos2000first}.

\subsection{Compositional distributional semantics}
\label{sec:composition}

Methods based on the distributional hypothesis have recently been applied to many tasks, but mostly at the word level, for instance, word sense disambiguation \cite{ZhitomirskyGeffet2009} and lexical substitution \cite{Thater:2010:CSR:1858681.1858778}. They exploit the notion of similarity which correlates with the angle between word vectors \cite{Turney:2010:FMV:1861751.1861756}.

\emph{Compositional} distributional semantics goes beyond the word level and models the meaning of phrases or sentences based on their parts. \newcite{mitchell-lapata:2008:ACLMain} perform composition of word vectors using vector addition and multiplication operations. The limitation of this approach is the operator associativity, which ignores the argument order, and thus word order. As a result, ``\textit{John loves Mary}'' and ``\textit{Mary loves John}'' get assigned the same meaning.

Concretely, if \textit{John}'s, \textit{Mary}'s and \textit{loves}'s meanings are
represented as vectors $\ov{\mathit{john}}$, $\ov{\mathit{mary}}$ and
$\ov{\mathit{loves}}$, the meaning of the sentence \textit{John loves Mary} is
$\ov{\mathit{john}} + \ov{\mathit{loves}} + \ov{\mathit{mary}}$.

To capture word order and the syntactic structure of a sentence, various approaches have been proposed. \newcite{Grefenstette:2011:ESC:2145432.2145580} extend the compositional approach by using non-associative linear algebra operators as proposed in the theoretical work of \newcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-4394}.

The functional applications of semantic terms can be replaced with tensors \cite{Bourbaki1998commutative}. Then, a transitive verb is represented by a matrix, which can be obtained from a corpus using the formula $\sum_i\ov{s_i} \otimes \ov{o_i}$ \cite{Grefenstette:2011:ESC:2145432.2145580}, where $\ov{s_i}$ and $\ov{o_i}$ are the subject-object pairs of the verb and $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product. The vector of the whole sentence is $\overline{\mathit{loves}} \odot(\ov{\mathit{john}} \otimes \ov{\mathit{mary}})$, where $\odot$ is the element-wise product.

% Should this have a vector symbol above it, rather than a straight line?
% DM: no, becausue it's a matrix, not a vector.
% ^.

\subsection{Similarity of heads in context}
\label{sec:similarity-context}

A noun phrase can be similar to a noun, as in \textit{female lion} and \textit{lioness}, and to other noun phrases as in \textit{yellow car} and \textit{cheap taxi}. The same similarity principle can be applied to phrases as well as to words. In this case, similarity is measured in \emph{context}, and most methods of calculating similarity of phrases still rely on comparisons of the phrases' head words, which meanings are modified by the arguments they appear with \cite{Kintsch2001173}.

\newcite{mitchell-lapata:2008:ACLMain,mitchell2010composition} use element-wise addition and multiplication to model argument interaction. \newcite{Baroni2010nouns} represents adjectives as matrices that modify nouns (vectors) using matrix multiplication.

\newcite{Dinu:2010:MDS:1870658.1870771} model word meaning as a distribution over senses; a context feature (other word in the context)  directly modulates word’s sense distribution using conditional probability. \newcite{thater-furstenau-pinkal:2011:IJCNLP-2011} contextualise vectors by assigning higher weight to features that correspond or are distributionally similar to the context words.

% \cite{Seaghdha:2011:PMS:2145432.2145545}.

With verbs, similarity in context can be applied to compare a transitive and intransitive verb. For example, \textit{cycle} is similar to \textit{ride a bicycle}. Here we see that \textit{a bicycle} disambiguates the verb \textit{ride} making the phrase similar to the verb \textit{cycle}. The connection between measuring similarity of a phrase and disambiguation has been noted in \newcite{kartsaklis-sadrzadeh-pulman:2013:CoNLL-2013}.

% TODO: mention \cite{wieting2015paraphrase}

Sentential similarity might be treated as the similarity of the heads in their contexts. That is, the similarity between \textit{sees} and \textit{notices} in \textit{John \textbf{sees} Mary} and \textit{John \textbf{notices} a woman}. This approach abstracts away the grammatical difference between the sentences and concentrates on their semantics.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:intrinsic-evaluation}

The difference in occurrence between two words quantifies the difference in their meaning \cite{harris1954distributional} and there is a machinery to measure the difference in the meanings of two sentences \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-4394}. The final necessary part is the evaluation methodology to test this approach.

Because it is difficult to perform extrinsic evaluation (also called evaluation in use) to measure the performance of a similarity component in a pipeline of a complete natural language processing system (for example, a dialog system), intrinsic datasets that focus on similarity are popular among computational linguists.

Apart from a pragmatic attempt to alleviate the problems of evaluating
similarity components, these datasets serve as an empirical test of the
hypotheses of Firth and Harris, bringing together our understanding of the human mind, language and technology. The following sections introduce the main datasets used in this area.

\subsection{Word similarity}
\label{sec:lexical-similarity}

\newcite{Rubenstein:1965:CCS:365628.365657} performed an empirical study on the relationship between the similarity in word meaning and similarity of contexts they appear in. They build a list of 65 word pairs that range from highly synonymous to semantically unrelated.

To obtain the similarity judgements, the human subjects were given a shuffled deck of card. Each card contained a word pair from the list. They were asked to sort the cards by similarity, so that the most similar items appeared in the top of the deck. In addition to ranking, human subjects were asked to give similarity scores ranging from 4.0 to 0.0, where the higher value indicates the higher similarity level.

100 sentences for each distinct word in the list were written by 50 participants (they did not provide similarity judgements) to be used as the contexts. The words from the list had to be used as nouns and the sentences had to be at least 10 words long.

To measure similarity, the overlap was calculated over tokens and types. The token condition takes into account the appearance frequencies of context words, while the type condition only considers the word types. So if the word \textit{table} appeared 10 times as a context of a word of interest, in the case of the token condition all 10 occurrences are considered, in the case of the type condition only the fact that it appeared as a context is recorded.

Formally, the overlap $M_x$ over condition $x$ between the word context of words $A$ and $B$ was calculated as:
%
\begin{equation*}
  M_x = \frac{N(A_xB_x)}{\min(N(A_x), N(B_x))}
\end{equation*}
%
where $N(A_xB_x)$ is the number of context words shared between $A$ and $B$ under condition $x$. $N(A_x)$ and $N(B_x)$ are the number of context words under condition $x$ for the words $A$ and $B$ respectively.

They found that the more similar words in meaning are the more context they share for both token and type conditions. Moreover, the relationship is strongest for the highly synonymous pairs, namely the pairs with similairty greater than 3.0.

\newcite{1986-13502-00119860101} studied the similarity relation from the psychological perspective. They analysed the similarity judgements between the entries by their geometric structure. The geometric approach represents the entries as points in a multidimensional space so that the distance between them reflects the similarity.

They examined 100 datasets to identify common geometric patterns. The datasets contained entries that belonged to a single category such as \textit{verbs of judging} \cite{FILLENBAUM197454} or \textit{animal terms} \cite{HENLEY1969176}. The reason for category oriented similarity studies was that ``stimuli can only be compared in so far as they have already been categorised as identical, alike, or equivalent at some higher level of abstraction'' \cite{turner1987rediscovering}.

They observed that if a category contains a superordinate, similarity judgements arrange category members around it. For example, similarity judgements given by humans arrange fruit names around the word \textit{fruit} in such a way that it is their nearest neighbour, making \textit{fruit} the \emph{focal point} of the category of \textit{fruits}.

An important consequence is that high centrality values cannot be achieved in a space with dimensionality of two or three,  because the dimensionality sets the upper bound on the number of points that can share the nearest neighbour.

\newcite{2002:PSC:503104.503110} proposed a context oriented information retrieval framework. The idea that the meaning of the word \textit{jaguar} is dependent on the context the search is performed. It might be a car, if the query comes from an automotive website, or it might mean an animal if it comes from a website about nature. To evaluate their semantic component they developed a dataset WS353 that consists of 353 diverse noun pairs along with their relatedness scores on a scale from 0 (totally unrelated) to 10 (very much related or identical). The combination of a vector-based method and a WordNet-based method achieved correlation of 0.55. The dataset they proposed is widely used to evaluate algorithms that estimate semantic similarity.

\newcite{Bruni:2012:DST:2390524.2390544} introduced the MEN dataset to test a multimodal semantic space (the model used textual and visual features). The new dataset contains the words that appear in labels of the ESP-Game\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/}} and MIRFLICKR-1M\footnote{\url{http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/}} image collections. Compared to WS353 it is sufficiently large to be split to the development part (2000 pairs) and to the test part (1000 pairs) for evaluation. The dataset contain highly similar items (\textit{cathedral}, \textit{church}, 0.94) and also terms that stand in a broader semantic relationship, such as whole-part (\textit{flower}, \textit{petal}, 0.92). The scores are relatedness scores on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

The Spearman correlation of the judgements given by two authors of the paper for all 3000 pairs is 0.68. The correlation with the average of their scores with the dataset scores is 0.84, which can be taken as the upper bound. The best presented results are 0.75 for WS353 and 0.78 for MEN, note that two different models produce them.

\newcite{hill2014simlex} presented SimLex-999, a gold standard resource for evaluating distributional semantic models. In contrast to WS353 and MEN it focuses on similarity rather than relatedness. The words \textit{coffee} and \textit{cup} are related but not similar. The dataset consists of 666 noun-pairs, 222 verb-pairs and 111 adjective-pairs. 500 residents of the USA were recruited to collect human judgements. The average pairwise Spearman correlation between two participants is 0.67, however the average correlation of a human rater with the average of all the other raters is 0.78.

They tested several models on WS353, MEN and WordSim-999. They showed that existing models achieved lower correlation on SimLex-999 than on WS353 and MEN suggesting that the new dataset required development of similarity-specific models. The best reported results are 0.44 on WS353, 0.48 on MEN and 0.28 on SimLex-999, these are different models, but all of them are trained on 150 million word RCV1 Corpus \cite{lewis2004rcv1}. Neural models trained on a larger corpus (Wikipedia) yield higher results.

Table~\ref{tab:lexical-dataset-comparison} presents the key models and the results they achieved on WS353, MEN and SimLex-999.

\subsection{Parameter selection}
\label{sec:parameter-selection-intro}

The variance of results on word similarity tasks can be explained by the differences in algorithms or by difference in model parameters, corpus used and other factors. For example, \newcite{baroni-dinu-kruszewski:2014:P14-1} uses a corpus of 2.8 billion tokens and outperforms \newcite{hill2014simlex}, who uses a corpus of 0.15 billion tokens, on MEN by 0.28 points with a distributional model and by 0.37 with neural word embeddings.

\newcite{Bullinaria2007} presented a thorough study of the parameters of distributional models. They tested various vector space parameters and similarity measures.

Instead of raw co-occurrence counts they used the conditional probability of a context word appearing close to a target word $P(c|t)$. In addition to that, they used \emph{point-wise mutual information} $\operatorname{PMI(c,t)} = \log\left(\frac{P(c,t)}{P(c)P(t)}\right)$, positive PMI, which nullifies negative values and probability ratio $\frac{P(c|t)}{P(c)}$. They varied the vector space dimensionality from 1 to 100000 dimensions.  Cosine, Euclidean and City Block geometric measures were used to estimate similarity. They used the 87.9 million word British National Corpus and performed an exhaustive search across the parameter combinations.

A vector space with vector components computed with positive PMI and cosine similarity measure performed the best in their experiments. They also showed that the performance depends on the size of the corpus used, the larger the corpus, the better the results. The context window of size one produced the best results. The model performance peaked when 1000 dimensional vector space was used and dropped afterwards.

\newcite{kiela-clark:2014:CVSC} performed a systematic study of distributional models on various datasets including WS353 and MEN. They confirmed findings of \newcite{Bullinaria2007} that larger corpora lead to better performance. They suggested using ukWaC (2 billion tokens) over the BNC with a small context window of size less than 5 from each side. Positive PMI was the best performed measure in combination with the \emph{correlation similarity} measure, which is the mean-adjusted cosine similarity. The dimensionality of 50000 appeared to be optimal.

\citet{kiela-clark:2014:CVSC} advocated incremental parameter tuning, reasoning that compositional tasks need a vector space model that is good in lexical tasks. Practically, this means that first a good lexical model is identified and only then it is used to find a well performing compositional operator. \citet{BullinariaLevy2012} followed the same reasoning, first good sparse models are identified, and then dimensionality reduction methods are compared to find the best one.

\citet{lapesa-evert:2013:CMCL} argue against incremental tuning because it does not capture parameter interaction. For example, a compositional operator might benefit from a specific weighting scheme, which is not necessarily the best in predicting word similarity. Their goal was to contrast rank-based prediction of semantic priming with distance-based prediction. Because they were introducing rank-based prediction, they could not reuse recommendations of parameters that are derived from distance-based similarity experiments. They covered a broad range of parameters of distributional models aiming at identification of parameter configurations that achieve good performance in predicting semantic priming.

They used linear regression to determine the importance of individual parameters and their combinations. Distributional semantics model parameters, such as the weighting scheme, vector space dimensionality and similarity metric, were considered predictors of model performance: the parameters of distributional models were independent parameters of a linear model and distributional model performance scores was dependant variable. Analysis of variance was used to determine the most important parameters and their interactions. They showed that a statistical association measures---such as t-score or z-score \cite{Evert05}---with combination of ranked-based prediction over cosine similarities yielded the best results. Would they performed only iterative tuning, they would test ranked-based prediction only with PMI weighting, which underperformed in their experiments.

In a successive study that included word similarity, \citet{lapesa2014large} showed that the combination of the similarity score together with the weighting scheme was the most important parameter combination, supporting findings of \newcite{Bullinaria2007} and \newcite{kiela-clark:2014:CVSC}, who suggested to use PMI together with cosine similarity.

%With their analysis they were also to perform model selection that is robust to overfitting. In most cases, the result of their robust parameter optimisation was close to the highest score. They considered the highest score they achieved to be overfitted because 537600 models were tested and there was a high chance that the best performance happened by chance.

\newcite{baroni-dinu-kruszewski:2014:P14-1} and \newcite{TACL570} performed systematic parameter studies on distributional and neural models. Notably, the work of \newcite{TACL570} evaluated models on all three datasets (WS353, MEN and SimLex-999, see Table~\ref{tab:lexical-dataset-comparison}). Their best distributional model outperformed the distributional models presented in \citet{hill2014simlex}, \citet{kiela-clark:2014:CVSC} and \citet{baroni-dinu-kruszewski:2014:P14-1}.

\subsection{Disambiguation of verbs in context}
\label{sec:disamb}

The transitive verb disambiguation dataset
% \footnote{This and the sentence  similarity datasets are available at \url{http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/compdistmeaning/}}
described in \newcite{Grefenstette:2011:ETV:2140490.2140497} consists of ambiguous transitive verbs together with their arguments, landmark verbs (which identify one of the verb senses) and human judgements (which specify the similarity to the landmarks of the disambiguated sense of the verb in the given context). This is similar to the intransitive dataset described in \newcite{mitchell-lapata:2008:ACLMain}.

Consider the sentence \textit{system meets specification}. \textit{Meets} is an ambiguous transitive verb, and \textit{system}
and \textit{specification} are its arguments. Possible landmarks for \emph{meet} are \textit{satisfy} and \textit{visit}. For this sentence, the human judgements show that the disambiguated verb meaning is similar to the landmark \textit{satisfy}, and less similar to \textit{visit}.

The task is to estimate the similarity of the sense of a verb in a context with a given landmark. To estimate similarity, the verb is composed with its arguments, it is done the same for the landmark and the arguments, and the similarity of the two vectors is computed. To evaluate performance, the human judgements are averaged for the same verb, argument and landmark entries, and these average values are used to calculate the correlation.

\subsection{Sentence similarity}
\label{sec:sentence-similarity}

The transitive sentence similarity dataset described in \newcite{kartsaklis-sadrzadeh-pulman:2013:CoNLL-2013} consists of transitive sentence pairs and human similarity judgements. The task is to estimate similarity between two sentences. The evaluation is the same as in the disambiguation task (Section~\ref{sec:disamb}).

In general, there is no systematic study of parameters of compositional models similar to lexical studies discussed in Section~\ref{sec:parameter-selection-intro}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion-comp}

Similarity is an important notion in psychological theories of knowledge and behaviour. It is also useful in explaining language. Many NLP systems benefit from internal similarity components. However the exact definition of similarity is task-dependant: an IR system needs to know whether the words are related (for example, the verb \textit{swim} is related to the noun \textit{lake}), language models benefit from semantic similarity (the noun \textit{lake} is similar to the noun\textit{reservoir}, but not to the verb \textit{swim}), dialog systems need to know the similarity of roles utterances---not individual words---play in a discourse (\textit{Hi!} and \textit{Good morning.} are both greetings).

Representation of words and multi-word units (sentences, utterances, documents) to measure similarity within one framework is theoretically challenging. \newcite{goodman1972problems} argues that the similarity relation does not exist, because everything can be shown to be similar to everything else. \newcite{medin1993respects} and \newcite{Markman1996} response that similarity has to be contextualised to be measured, that is, the features of interest need to be defined before the measurement.

According to \newcite{harris1954distributional}, the word meaning does not need to be obtained to measure similarity, instead, the differences of occurrences of two words quantify the difference in their meaning. In this way the problems with representing meaning in isolation raised by Frege are avoided, because word meaning is not constructed.

The principle of compositionality, that the representations of compounds are built from their parts, is the hallmark of categorical compositional semantics \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-4394}. It extends the composition mechanism from formal semantics by replacing the representation of atoms and relations with tensors of various orders.

In formal semantics, the meaning of a phrase is obtained by applying backward and forward application rules. Consider a phrase \textit{John walks}. In this example, the string \textit{John} is the atom $\mathit{John'}$ of category $\mathtt{np}$ and type $e$, \textit{walks} is the relation $\lambda x.\mathit{walks'}(x)$ of category $\mathtt{np\backslash{}s}$ and type $e \to t$. During the phrase composition, the backward application rule is applied, so the category of the whole string becomes $\mathtt{s}$, its type is $t$ which is either \textit{true} or \textit{false} and the meaning is computed by the evaluation of the formula $\mathit{walks'}(\mathit{John'})$, basically the atom $\mathit{John'}$ is applied to the formula $\lambda x.\mathit{walks'(x)}$.

Categorical compositional semantics replaces atomic symbols in formal semantics with vectors (first-order tensors), and relations with higher-order tensors (so \textit{walks} is represented by a second-order tensor, which is a matrix). To obtain the representation of a compound, tensor contraction is used instead of function application.

Word similarity (in the broad psychological sense) has been studied extensively: many datasets were proposed that focus on relatedness and similarity (in the specific sense that \textit{lake} is similar to \textit{reservoir}, but is not similar to \textit{swim}). Several studies were carried out to identify the best parameter choice for the models of similarity.

Phrase similarity on the other hand, has been studies much less. There are several datasets proposed that focus on different aspects of similarity (for example, its application in word sense disambiguation within a context and similarity measurement of sentences). Several compositional methods are developed. However, the compositional methods were not evaluated in a systematic way to identify the best parameters (for example, the co-occurrence weighting function among the others).

This thesis addresses this gap by carrying out an extensive parameter study of compositional models of similarity.
